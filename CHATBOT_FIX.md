# 🤖 Chatbot Behavior Fix - Lead Data Context

## ❌ **Problem**
When loading a lead (e.g., "Ronnie Yates") from the Manage Leads tab, the chatbot would ask for information **it already had**:

- User loads "Ronnie Yates" (with all property info)
- Chatbot says: "Could you please provide me with your full name?"
- User has to re-type information that was already loaded ❌

## ✅ **Solution**

### 1. **Inject Lead Data into System Prompt**
Modified `components/chatbot.py` → `get_response()` method:

```python
# If we have lead data already, add it to the system context
if current_lead_data:
    lead_context = "\n\n**CURRENT LEAD INFORMATION (Already Known):**\n"
    if "name" in current_lead_data:
        lead_context += f"- Client Name: {current_lead_data['name']}\n"
    # ... (property value, balance, cash out, veteran status, address)
    
    lead_context += "\n**IMPORTANT**: You already have this information. DO NOT ask for it again."
    system_prompt += lead_context
```

**Result**: The AI knows what information it already has and won't ask for it again! ✅

### 2. **Auto-Greeting When Lead is Loaded**
Modified `app.py` to show a personalized greeting when a lead is first loaded:

```python
if st.session_state.lead_just_loaded:
    greeting = f"Hello {first_name}! I see you're interested in "
    if cash_out > 0:
        greeting += f"a cash-out refinance to get ${cash_out:,}..."
    # ... personalized message with lead's info
```

**Result**: Lead sees they're recognized immediately! ✅

### 3. **Clear Chat History on Lead Switch**
When switching to a different lead, the chat history is cleared to avoid confusion:

```python
st.session_state.messages = []  # Start fresh with new lead
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Before** (❌ Broken):
1. Click "💬 Chat" button for Ronnie Yates
2. Chatbot: "Hello! What's your full name?"
3. User: "Ronnie Yates" (frustrated - you already know this!)
4. Chatbot: "What's your property value?"
5. User: "$460,000" (it's right there in the system!)

### **After** (✅ Fixed):
1. Click "💬 Chat" button for Ronnie Yates
2. Chatbot: "Hello Ronnie! I see you're interested in a cash-out refinance to get $80,000 from your property valued at $460,000. I have your information loaded. Would you like me to generate your personalized 3-option mortgage proposal?"
3. User: "Yes!" or asks specific questions
4. Chatbot provides relevant answers using the known information

## 📋 **What Information is Auto-Loaded**

When you click "💬 Chat" from Manage Leads, the chatbot instantly knows:
- ✅ Client's full name
- ✅ Property value
- ✅ Current mortgage balance
- ✅ Desired cash out amount
- ✅ Veteran status
- ✅ Property address
- ✅ Annual income (if available)

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Test Scenario 1: Load Ronnie Yates
```
1. Go to "Manage Leads" tab
2. Click "💬 Chat" next to Ronnie Yates
3. Expected: See personalized greeting with his info
4. Ask: "What would be rate after 20 years?"
5. Expected: Chatbot answers without asking for name/property info
```

### Test Scenario 2: Load Peter Walker
```
1. Go to "Manage Leads" tab
2. Click "💬 Chat" next to Peter Walker
3. Expected: See greeting for Peter (different from Ronnie)
4. Chat clears previous Ronnie conversation
5. All Peter's info is pre-loaded
```

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. **`components/chatbot.py`**
   - Modified `get_response()` to inject lead data into system prompt
   - Added lead context string building

2. **`app.py`**
   - Added `lead_just_loaded` session state flag
   - Added auto-greeting logic in chat view
   - Clear messages when switching leads
   - Pass `address` field to lead_data

## 💡 **Benefits**

1. **Better UX**: Users don't repeat information
2. **Faster Workflow**: Skip straight to questions/proposal
3. **More Professional**: Shows the system is intelligent
4. **Accurate Context**: AI uses exact loaded data, not extracted text
5. **Personalized**: Greeting tailored to each lead's situation

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**
